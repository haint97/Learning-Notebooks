## Fundamentals of HTTP

HTTP is a stateless, request-response protocol that underpins web communication. Clients (e.g., browsers, mobile apps) send requests to servers, which respond with data or status information.

### HTTP Request and Response Structure
An HTTP request consists of:
- **Start Line**: Method, URL, and HTTP version (e.g., `GET /api/users HTTP/1.1`).
- **Headers**: Key-value pairs for metadata (e.g., `Accept: application/json`).
- **Body**: Optional payload, often JSON or form data for POST/PUT.

A response includes:
- **Status Line**: HTTP version, status code, and message (e.g., `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`).
- **Headers**: Metadata like `Content-Length` or `Server`.
- **Body**: The requested data, like HTML or JSON.

**Example HTTP Request**:
```
GET /api/users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer xyz
```

**Example HTTP Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 45

{"id": 123, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}
```

**Mermaid Diagram**: HTTP Request-Response Flow

    participant Server
    Client->>Server: GET /api/users/123 HTTP/1.1
    Note right of Client: Headers: Accept, Authorization
    Server-->>Client: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Note right of Server: Headers: Content-Type<br>Body: JSON data
```

### HTTP Methods in Depth
Each method has specific semantics:
- **GET**: Retrieves a resource. Idempotent (same call, same result) and safe (no side effects).
- **POST**: Creates a resource. Non-idempotent, as repeated calls may create duplicates.
- **PUT**: Updates or creates a resource at a specific URL. Idempotent.
- **PATCH**: Partially updates a resource. May or may not be idempotent.
- **DELETE**: Removes a resource. Idempotent.
- **HEAD**: Like GET but returns only headers, used for metadata checks.
- **OPTIONS**: Lists allowed methods for a resource, critical for CORS.
- **TRACE**: Echoes the request for debugging (rarely used due to security risks).

**Real-World Example**:
- **GET**: Fetching a user profile on LinkedIn.
- **POST**: Submitting a payment form on Stripe.
- **PATCH**: Updating a user’s email in a CRM system.

### HTTP Status Codes Deep Dive
Status codes are grouped into five classes:
- **1xx (Informational)**: Rare, e.g., `101 Switching Protocols` for WebSocket upgrades.
- **2xx (Success)**:
  - `200 OK`: Request succeeded.
  - `201 Created`: Resource created (e.g., after POST).
  - `204 No Content`: Success, no body (e.g., DELETE).
- **3xx (Redirection)**:
  - `301 Moved Permanently`: Resource moved, update bookmarks.
  - `302 Found`: Temporary redirect.
  - `304 Not Modified`: Resource unchanged (for caching).
- **4xx (Client Error)**:
  - `400 Bad Request`: Malformed request.
  - `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required.
  - `403 Forbidden`: Access denied.
  - `404 Not Found`: Resource missing.
  - `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded.
- **5xx (Server Error)**:
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: Generic server failure.
  - `503 Service Unavailable`: Server down or overloaded.

**Deep Insight**: Status codes impact client behavior (e.g., browsers follow 3xx redirects automatically) and caching (304 for unchanged resources). Misusing codes (e.g., using 200 for errors) confuses clients and breaks conventions.

### HTTP Headers
Headers provide metadata for fine-grained control:
- **Request Headers**:
  - `Accept`: Desired response format (e.g., `application/json`).
  - `Authorization`: Credentials (e.g., Bearer tokens, Basic Auth).
  - `If-None-Match`: ETag for caching validation.
- **Response Headers**:
  - `Content-Type`: Format of body (e.g., `text/html`).
  - `Set-Cookie`: Session management.
  - `Retry-After`: For 429 or 503 responses, suggests delay.

**Deep Insight**: Headers are case-insensitive, and custom headers (e.g., `X-Custom-Header`) are common but should follow naming conventions to avoid conflicts.

### Evolution of HTTP Versions
- **HTTP/0.9 (1991)**: Text-only, single GET method, no headers.
- **HTTP/1.0 (1996)**: Added headers, status codes, and methods like POST.
- **HTTP/1.1 (1997)**:
  - Persistent connections (Keep-Alive) to reuse TCP connections.
  - Pipelining (send multiple requests without waiting, though rarely used due to head-of-line blocking).
  - Chunked transfer encoding for streaming.
- **HTTP/2 (2015)**:
  - Binary framing instead of text.
  - Multiplexing: Multiple requests/responses over one TCP connection.
  - Header compression (HPACK).
  - Server push: Proactively send resources.
- **HTTP/3 (2022)**:
  - Uses QUIC (UDP-based) instead of TCP.
  - Eliminates head-of-line blocking at the transport layer.
  - Faster connection setup with 0-RTT (zero round-trip time).

**Mermaid Diagram**: HTTP Evolution
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[HTTP/0.9: Text, GET Only] --> B[HTTP/1.0: Headers, Status Codes]
    B --> C[HTTP/1.1: Persistent Connections, Pipelining]
    C --> D[HTTP/2: Binary, Multiplexing, HPACK]
    D --> E[HTTP/3: QUIC, 0-RTT, No HOL Blocking]
```

**Deep Insight**: HTTP/2’s multiplexing reduces latency but requires careful server tuning to avoid resource contention. HTTP/3’s QUIC improves performance in lossy networks (e.g., mobile), but UDP firewall issues can complicate deployment.

## Advanced HTTP Topics

### Caching Deep Dive
Caching reduces server load and latency by storing responses.
- **Levels**:
  - **Browser Cache**: Controlled by `Cache-Control` headers (e.g., `max-age=3600`).
  - **Proxy Cache**: CDNs (e.g., Cloudflare) cache static assets globally.
  - **Reverse Proxy Cache**: Servers like Nginx cache responses.
- **Mechanisms**:
  - **ETag**: Hash of resource content for validation.
  - **Last-Modified**: Timestamp-based validation.
  - **Cache-Control**: Directives like `no-cache`, `private`, or `immutable`.
- **Challenges**:
  - Stale data: Use short TTLs or invalidation strategies.
  - Cache poisoning: Validate inputs to prevent malicious cache entries.

**Example**:
```http
Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400
ETag: "abc123"
```

**Deep Insight**: CDNs use edge caching to reduce latency, but dynamic content (e.g., user-specific data) requires cache-busting techniques like query params (`?v=123`) or versioning.

### Security in HTTP
- **HTTPS (TLS)**:
  - Encrypts data with TLS (Transport Layer Security).
  - Uses certificates for server authentication.
  - Mitigates man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - **Deep Insight**: TLS 1.3 reduces handshake latency and removes outdated ciphers, but misconfigured servers (e.g., weak ciphers) can expose vulnerabilities.
- **CORS**:
  - Restricts cross-origin requests via headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
  - Preflight requests (OPTIONS) check permissions for complex requests.
  - **Deep Insight**: Misconfigured CORS can lead to unauthorized access. Always specify exact origins instead of `*`.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**:
  - Prevented with tokens (e.g., random UUID in forms).
  - **Deep Insight**: SameSite cookies (`Lax` or `Strict`) reduce CSRF risks but require browser support.
- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**:
  - Forces HTTPS via `Strict-Transport-Security` header.
  - **Deep Insight**: Include `preload` for browser preloading, but test thoroughly to avoid locking out HTTP users.

**Real-World Example**: A banking app uses HTTPS with HSTS, OAuth2 tokens for authentication, and CSRF tokens for form submissions.

### Performance Optimizations
- **Compression**: Use Gzip or Brotli (`Content-Encoding`) to reduce payload size.
- **Connection Management**:
  - HTTP/1.1: Enable Keep-Alive.
  - HTTP/2: Leverage multiplexing and server push.
- **Content Delivery**:
  - Use CDNs for static assets.
  - Optimize images (e.g., WebP format).
- **Client-Side**:
  - Minimize requests with bundling (e.g., Webpack).
  - Lazy-load non-critical resources.

**Deep Insight**: HTTP/2 server push can backfire if overused, as it may send unneeded resources. Use tools like Lighthouse to audit performance.

### RESTful APIs In-Depth
REST leverages HTTP for resource-based APIs:
- **Principles**:
  - Stateless: Each request contains all necessary info.
  - Client-Server: Separation of concerns.
  - Cacheable: Responses can be cached.
  - Layered: Proxies or load balancers can be transparent.
  - Uniform Interface: Standard methods, resources, and conventions.
- **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)**:
  - Responses include links to related resources (e.g., `{"user": {...}, "links": {"self": "/users/123"}}`).
  - **Deep Insight**: Rarely used due to complexity, but enhances API discoverability.
- **Versioning**:
  - URL-based (e.g., `/v1/users`).
  - Header-based (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json`).
  - **Deep Insight**: Header-based versioning is cleaner but harder for clients to adopt.

**Table: REST vs Non-REST HTTP**

| Aspect            | REST                      | Non-REST HTTP             |
|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Resource-Based    | Yes (e.g., /users/123)    | No (e.g., /getUser)      |
| Stateless         | Yes                       | Optional                  |
| Standard Methods  | Yes (GET, POST, etc.)     | Maybe (custom actions)    |
| HATEOAS           | Optional                  | No                        |

**Real-World Example**: GitHub’s API (`/repos/{owner}/{repo}`) follows REST principles with clear resource paths and standard methods.

## Fundamentals of RPC

RPC abstracts network communication to resemble local function calls, making it ideal for distributed systems.

### How RPC Works
1. **Client Stub**: Serializes (marshals) function arguments into a network-friendly format.
2. **Network Transport**: Sends data to the server (often over TCP or HTTP/2).
3. **Server Stub**: Deserializes, executes the function, and serializes the response.
4. **Client Receives**: Deserializes and returns the result.

**Mermaid Diagram**: RPC Call Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ClientApp as Client App
    participant ClientStub as Client Stub
    participant Network
    participant ServerStub as Server Stub
    participant ServerApp as Server App
    ClientApp->>ClientStub: Call add(2, 3)
    ClientStub->>Network: Serialize args
    Network->>ServerStub: Send data
    ServerStub->>ServerApp: Deserialize, call add(2, 3)
    ServerApp-->>ServerStub: Return 5
    ServerStub-->>Network: Serialize result
    Network-->>ClientStub: Send data
    ClientStub-->>ClientApp: Deserialize, return 5
```

**Deep Insight**: Stubs are auto-generated from interface definitions (e.g., Protobuf in gRPC), reducing boilerplate but requiring schema maintenance.

### RPC Frameworks
- **gRPC**:
  - Uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers for serialization.
  - Supports unary, server-streaming, client-streaming, and bidirectional streaming.
  - **Deep Insight**: gRPC’s HTTP/2 usage enables multiplexing, but its binary nature complicates debugging without tools like BloomRPC.
- **Apache Thrift**:
  - Cross-language, supports multiple protocols (e.g., TCP, HTTP).
  - Flexible but less optimized than gRPC.
- **JSON-RPC**:
  - Lightweight, uses JSON over HTTP.
  - Limited to request-response, less performant than gRPC.
- **XML-RPC**:
  - Older, XML-based, rarely used today due to verbosity.

**Real-World Example**: Netflix uses gRPC for inter-service communication to minimize latency in its microservices architecture.

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous RPC
- **Synchronous**: Client blocks until response is received. Simple but can bottleneck.
  - Example: `result = service.GetUser(id)`.
- **Asynchronous**: Client continues, handles response via callbacks or promises.
  - Example: `service.GetUserAsync(id).then(result => ...)`.
- **Deep Insight**: Async RPC is critical for high-throughput systems but introduces complexity (e.g., callback hell, error handling).

## Advanced RPC Topics

### Service Discovery
In microservices, services need to locate each other dynamically:
- **Tools**: Consul, Eureka, Kubernetes Service Discovery.
- **Mechanism**: Services register with a registry; clients query it for endpoints.
- **Deep Insight**: DNS-based discovery (e.g., Kubernetes) is simpler but less flexible than registry-based systems like Consul, which support health checks.

### Load Balancing
Distributes RPC calls across servers:
- **Client-Side**: Client chooses server (e.g., gRPC’s built-in balancer).
- **Server-Side**: Proxy like Envoy distributes requests.
- **Strategies**:
  - Round-robin: Cycles through servers.
  - Least connections: Sends to least busy server.
  - Consistent hashing: Maps requests to servers for cache affinity.
- **Deep Insight**: Client-side balancing reduces latency but requires client updates when topology changes.

### Error Handling and Resilience
- **gRPC Status Codes**:
  - `OK`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`, `UNAVAILABLE`, etc.
  - More granular than HTTP’s status codes.
- **Retries**:
  - Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming servers.
  - **Deep Insight**: Idempotent RPCs (e.g., read operations) are safe to retry; non-idempotent ones need deduplication (e.g., request IDs).
- **Circuit Breaking**:
  - Halts requests to failing services to prevent cascading failures.
  - Tools: Hystrix, Envoy.
- **Timeouts**:
  - Set deadlines (e.g., gRPC’s `DeadlineExceeded`).
  - **Deep Insight**: Dynamic timeouts based on latency histograms improve reliability.

### Serialization: Protobuf vs JSON vs Avro
- **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)**:
  - Binary, schema-based, compact.
  - Used by gRPC.
  - **Deep Insight**: Backward/forward compatibility requires careful schema design (e.g., avoid removing required fields).
- **JSON**:
  - Text-based, human-readable.
  - Larger payloads, slower parsing.
- **Avro**:
  - Schema-based, used by Apache Kafka.
  - Supports schema evolution better than JSON.

**Table: Serialization Comparison**

| Feature         | Protobuf                  | JSON                      | Avro                      |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Format          | Binary                    | Text                      | Binary                    |
| Size            | Smallest                  | Largest                   | Medium                    |
| Parse Speed     | Fastest                   | Slowest                   | Fast                      |
| Schema Evolution| Good (with care)          | Poor (no strict schema)   | Excellent                 |
| Use Case        | gRPC, high-performance    | Web APIs, prototyping     | Data pipelines (Kafka)    |

**Deep Insight**: Protobuf’s efficiency comes at the cost of schema rigidity. Use tools like `protoc` to validate schemas during CI/CD.

### Streaming in RPC
gRPC supports:
- **Unary**: Single request, single response.
- **Server Streaming**: Single request, multiple responses (e.g., stock ticker).
- **Client Streaming**: Multiple requests, single response (e.g., file upload).
- **Bidirectional Streaming**: Both sides send multiple messages (e.g., chat app).
- **Deep Insight**: Streaming reduces latency for real-time apps but requires careful flow control to avoid buffer overflows.

## HTTP vs RPC: Deep Comparison

**Table: HTTP (REST) vs RPC**

| Aspect                | HTTP (REST)                          | RPC (e.g., gRPC)                     |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Protocol              | Text-based, stateless                | Binary, can be stateful              |
| Transport             | HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3            | HTTP/2 (gRPC), TCP (Thrift)          |
| Overhead              | High (text headers)                 | Low (binary, compact)                |
| Abstraction           | Resource-based                      | Function-based                       |
| Flexibility           | High (loose contracts)              | Medium (strict schemas)              |
| Streaming             | Limited (HTTP/2 push, WebSockets)   | Native (unary, streaming)            |
| Error Handling        | Status codes (e.g., 404)            | Detailed codes (e.g., UNAVAILABLE)   |
| Use Case              | Public APIs, web services           | Internal microservices, low-latency  |
| Tooling               | Postman, cURL                       | BloomRPC, gRPCurl                    |

**When to Use**:
- **HTTP/REST**:
  - Public-facing APIs (e.g., Twitter API).
  - Heterogeneous clients (browsers, mobile apps).
  - Need for human-readable payloads.
- **RPC**:
  - Internal microservices (e.g., Google’s backend).
  - High-performance, low-latency requirements.
  - Strong typing and schema enforcement.

**Deep Insight**: REST’s loose coupling suits evolving APIs, but RPC’s performance and streaming make it ideal for tightly controlled systems. Mixing both (e.g., REST for external, RPC for internal) is common in large-scale architectures like Netflix.


## Best Practices

### HTTP Best Practices
1. **Security**:
   - Always use HTTPS with TLS 1.3.
   - Implement OAuth2 or JWT for authentication.
   - Use CSRF tokens and SameSite cookies.
2. **Performance**:
   - Enable compression (Brotli preferred).
   - Use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 where supported.
   - Cache aggressively but invalidate correctly.
3. **API Design**:
   - Follow REST conventions (noun-based URLs, standard methods).
   - Use pagination for large datasets (e.g., `?page=2&size=50`).
   - Document with OpenAPI/Swagger.
4. **Monitoring**:
   - Log requests with correlation IDs.
   - Monitor with Prometheus/Grafana for latency and errors.

### RPC Best Practices
1. **Schema Management**:
   - Version Protobuf schemas carefully.
   - Use tools like `buf` for linting and breaking change detection.
2. **Resilience**:
   - Implement circuit breakers (e.g., with Envoy).
   - Use exponential backoff for retries.
   - Set deadlines for all calls.
3. **Performance**:
   - Optimize Protobuf schemas for minimal size.
   - Use connection pooling in gRPC clients.
4. **Security**:
   - Enable mTLS for mutual authentication.
   - Restrict access with IAM policies.

**Deep Insight**: Use observability tools (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to trace RPC calls across services for debugging distributed systems.

## Interview Preparation

### Common Interview Questions
1. **HTTP**:
   - Explain the difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. (Focus on multiplexing, header compression.)
   - How would you handle a 429 Too Many Requests error? (Rate limiting, backoff.)
   - Design a REST API for a blog platform. (Define endpoints, methods, and error handling.)
2. **RPC**:
   - How does gRPC improve performance over REST? (Binary protocol, HTTP/2, streaming.)
   - Explain error handling in gRPC. (Status codes, retries, deadlines.)
   - When would you choose RPC over REST? (Internal, low-latency systems.)
3. **System Design**:
   - Design a scalable notification system. (Use HTTP for client APIs, gRPC for internal services.)
   - How would you handle millions of requests per second? (Load balancing, caching, async processing.)

### How to Approach
- **Start Simple**: Explain the basics (e.g., HTTP methods).
- **Go Deep**: Discuss trade-offs (e.g., REST’s flexibility vs. RPC’s performance).
- **Use Diagrams**: Sketch request flows or system architectures.
- **Show Practicality**: Reference real-world tools (e.g., Envoy, Prometheus).
- **Handle Edge Cases**: Discuss retries, timeouts, and failures.

**Example System Design**: Notification System
