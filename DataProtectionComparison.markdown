| **Definition**                | Replaces sensitive data with fictional or obscured characters, preserving format but not the original data.                                               | Transforms sensitive data into unreadable ciphertext using a key, reversible with the correct key.                                                        | Replaces sensitive data with a non-sensitive token, reversible (vault-based) or non-reversible (vaultless).                                           |
| **Purpose**                   | Protect sensitive data for display or logging, preventing exposure in non-secure contexts.                                                                | Secure sensitive data during storage or transmission, ensuring only authorized access.                                                                    | Reduce sensitive data scope in systems, minimizing exposure in storage/transmission.                                                                  |
| **Strength**                  | Simple, lightweight, no key management; preserves format for display compatibility.                                                                       | Strong cryptographic security (e.g., AES-256); reversible for authorized access.                                                                          | Reduces compliance scope; format-preserving tokens fit existing schemas.                                                                              |
| **Challenge**                 | Non-reversible, limited to display/logging; requires careful pattern design.                                                                              | Complex key management (rotation, versioning); performance overhead.                                                                                      | Requires tokenization system; vault-based needs secure vault; vaultless needs key management.                                                         |
| **Data Format**               | Preserves input format/length (e.g., SSN `123-45-6789` → `***-**-****`).                                                                                  | Longer output (base64-encoded, includes IV); not format-preserving.                                                                                       | Format-preserving (e.g., SSN `123-45-6789` → `ABC-DE-FGHI`) or unrelated.                                                                             |
| **Storage Consideration**     | Fits existing schemas; no key management; for display-only fields.                                                                                        | Requires larger fields; key management critical; for reversible storage.                                                                                  | Fits schemas if format-preserving; needs vault/system for reversibility.                                                                              |
| **Transmission**              | Not suitable for usable data transmission; used for logging/display.                                                                                      | Ideal for secure transmission (e.g., APIs); requires decryption.                                                                                          | Suitable where raw data isn’t needed; reversible tokens detokenized.                                                                                  |
| **Security**                  | No cryptographic protection; protects against exposure in non-secure contexts.                                                                            | Strong security with proper key management; vulnerable if keys compromised.                                                                               | Reduces data scope; security depends on vault or key management.                                                                                      |
| **Interview Talking Points**  | Emphasize simplicity, non-reversible nature; discuss regex customization for formats. Example: "Masking is ideal for UI/logs to reduce compliance scope." | Discuss AES-256, key rotation/versioning; highlight secure transmission/storage. Example: "Encryption is ideal for APIs but needs robust key management." | Differentiate vaultless (FPE) vs. vault-based; discuss scope reduction. Example: "Tokenization minimizes sensitive data in databases for compliance." |
| **Data Usability**            | Usable for display (UI, logs) or testing; not for analytics requiring real data.                                                                          | Limited usability without decryption; not for testing/analytics.                                                                                          | Usable for testing/analytics if format-preserving; limited without detokenization.                                                                    |
| **Reversibility**             | **Irreversible**: Original data cannot be recovered.                                                                                                      | **Reversible**: Original data recoverable with key.                                                                                                       | **Reversible (vault-based)** or **Non-reversible (vaultless)**.                                                                                       |
| **Security Level**            | Low                                                                                                                                                       | High                                                                                                                                                      | Medium                                                                                                                                                |
| **Use Cases**                 | Display in UI/reports (e.g., masked SSNs); logging without sensitive data.                                                                                | Secure storage (e.g., credit cards); data in transit (e.g., API payloads).                                                                                | Database storage (e.g., tokenized SSNs); transmission without raw data.                                                                               |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Low: Simple string manipulation, no keys.                                                                                                                 | High: Requires key management, secure storage.                                                                                                            | Medium: Vaultless needs keys; vault-based needs secure vault.                                                                                         |
| **Performance Impact**        | Low: Minimal overhead (string operations).                                                                                                                | High: Cryptographic operations add latency.                                                                                                               | Medium: FPE similar to encryption; vault lookup adds latency.                                                                                         |
| **Compliance Support**        | GDPR, PCI DSS (reduces scope for display/logs).                                                                                                           | GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA (encrypts sensitive data).                                                                                                           | GDPR, PCI DSS (reduces sensitive data scope).                                                                                                         |
